<div style='background: #333'>Major religious texts of the world's religions</div>
 <p>While not every religious tradition includes a unitary sacred text, many of the world's major religions do. The goal of this page is to present a factual representation of the most-read and most-revered religious texts in the world, based on the number of adherents who belong to the religions that emphasize these texts. For example, the Christian Bible is read or revered by over 2.5 billion Christians worldwide, but the Hebrew Tanakh—which forms the basis for the Christian Old Testament—is believed in and revered by both Christians and Jews, which is why it appears here before the Christian New Testament. In the following list, only a single sacred text is included for each major religion, even in cases where multiple holy books exist for that religion. The goal is to familiarize the reader with the most revered text of each religious tradition, and eventually to include the full text of each as well.

<div style='background: #500'>Hebrew Tanakh</div>
 <p>The Hebrew Tanakh is the record of God's dealings with humankind—and in particular, with the Hebrew people—beginning with Adam and Eve and continuing through major prophets such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and a series of other prophets, kings, saints, and sinners. The Tanakh is traditionally divided into three sections: the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The Hebrew names of these sections—<cite>Torah</cite>, <cite>Nevi’īm</cite>, and <cite>Kethuvīm</cite>—contribute the first letter of each word to form the name <cite><u>T</u>a<u>n</u>a<u>k</u>h</cite>. While the ordering of some of the books differs, the Hebrew Tanakh is also the basis for the Christian Old Testament, and as such, forms the foundation for two major world religions, making it the most widely read and revered holy book of any religious belief system.</p>

<br>Number of adherents: 2.8 billion
<br>Original language: Hebrew
<br>Written/compiled: 1500 BCE—400 BCE</p>

<div style='background: #530'>New Testament</div>
 <p>The New Testament is the record of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, as well as the acts and teachings of his early followers: apostles, disciples, and others chosen by him to convey the “good news” of his message to the world. Seen by Christians as the fulfilment of the prophecies of the Old Testament, the New Testament adds to and builds upon the existing Judaic relationship with the God of Abraham, and outlines a new covenant with Jesus at its center.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Christianity
<br>Number of adherents: 2.7 billion
<br>Original language: Koine Greek
<br>Written/compiled: 30 CE—400 CE</p>

<div style='background: #550'>Qur’an</div>
 <p>The Qur’an is the holy book of Islam, and belief in it is an article of faith of all Muslims. The word <cite>qur’&amacr;n</cite> literally means “recitation”, and faithful Muslims believe that the Qur’an is a word-for-word recitation of revelation received directly from God by the prophet Muhammad, giving instructions and clarification to humankind about our proper relationship with God. The chapters (surahs) of the Qur’an are not compiled chronologically, but rather appear longest to shortest.</p>
<p class='info'>Relgious tradition: Islam
<br>Number of adherents: 1.1 billion
<br>Original language: Arabic
<br>Written/compiled: 600 CE</p>

<div style='background: #350'>Bhagavad Gita</div>
 <p>The Bhagavad Gita—often translated as “The Song of God”—is a record that makes up part of the Mahabharata epic, a historico-religious epic detailing the battles and relationships between earthly rulers, kingdoms, and the gods that favored or cursed them. The Bhagavad Gita specifically is the record of a conversation between Krishna, appearing as an incarnation of Divinity, and a warrior-leader named Arjuna, guiding him and instructing him as he prepares for battle with his enemies.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Hinduism
<br>Number of adherents: 901 million
<br>Original language: Sanskrit
<br>Written/compiled: 400 BCE</p>

<div style='background: #050'>Tripitaka</div>
 <p>The Tripitaka is the most revered of the buddhavacana—words of the Buddha—and is accepted by both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism. Literally translated as “three baskets”, the Tripitaka is a collection of three collections of sacred texts, including the Vinaya Pitaka (teaching rules and discipline), the Sutta Pitaka (sayings, discourses, and sermons of the Buddha), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Buddhist doctrines and philosophy). While there are different versions of the Tripitaka, the most commonly cited is the Pali Canon.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Buddhism
<br>Number of adherents: 329 million
<br>Original language: Pali
<br>Written/compiled: 100 BCE</p>

<div style='background: #053'>I Ching</div>
 <p>The I Ching, often called the “Book of Changes”, is an ancient Chinese divination text, and one of the Five Classics of Confucian thought, and are also read and revered by Taoists, and Buddhists, to a lesser extent. As a book of divination, the I Ching provides instructions and interpretations for predicting future events, making decisions, and finding wisdom about the world as it is, all using a set of divinations involving various combinations of yarrow sticks into any of 64 different divinatory hexagrams. The I Ching is traditionally thought to have been written or at least compiled by Confucius himself.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious traditions: Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism
<br>Number of adherents: 26 million
<br>Original language: Old Chinese
<br>Written/compiled: 900—300 BCE</p>

<div style='background: #035'>Guru Granth Sahib</div>
 <p>Guru Granth Sahib is the holy book of the Sikh religion, and is considered to the final of the gurus sent by God to enlighten and teach humankind. The Guru Granth Sahib contains a series of hymns, as well as teachings of various of the Sikh gurus, and also the teachings of a number of Hindu Bhakti saints and one Muslim Sufi saint. Unlike the human gurus of Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib is seen as the eternal guru that will never die and will always be present to guide Sikhs in their effort to draw nearer to God. The Guru Granth Sahib is always written in the Gurmukhi script, a writing system devised by the second Sikh guru. Because the Sikh gurus were from various regions of India, the text of the Guru Granth Sahib was originally composed in various languages. Some parts are composed in Sant Bhasha, a hybrid language which intentionally uses vocabulary common to a number of Northern Indian languages to be understandable to the largest number of people.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Sikhism
<br>Number of adherents: 23 million
<br>Original language: Various
<br>Written/compiled: 1564—1604 CE</p>

<div style='background: #005'>Tao Te Ching</div>
 <p>The Tao Te Ching, also called the Dao De Jing, is traditionally said to have been written by the Taoist religious philosopher Lao Tzu. It is a series of short meditations detailing Taoist thought, from concepts such as non-doing to ideas such as “going with the flow”, which have become common even where Taoism is not well known. The Tao Te Ching is a short work, but can leave the reader with enough to ponder to last a lifetime.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Taoism
<br>Number of adherents: 20 million
<br>Original language: Old Chinese
<br>Written/compiled: 400 BCE</p>

<div style='background: #305'>Book of Mormon</div>
 <p>The Book of Mormon is a record that faithful members of the Latter-day Saint movement—sometimes referred to as Mormonism—believe to have been received by the prophet Joseph Smith from an angel of God. It tells the story of a series of prophets, kings, and others led away from Israel to the Americas around the reign of Jewish King Zedekiah, and also relates the appearance of the resurrected Jesus Christ to these individuals in the Americas. Believers emphasize that just as the Bible is composed of the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Latter-day Saint movement (Restorationist Christian)
<br>Number of adherents: 16 million
<br>Original language: English
<br>Written/compiled: 1827–1829 CE</p>

<div style='background: #505'>Kitab-i-Aqdas</div>
 <p>The Kitab-i-Aqdas, translated as “The Most Holy Book”, is the primary religious text of the Baha’i faith, written by the religion's founder Baha’ullah in 1873. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is presented as a series of teachings and guidance to faithful Baha’is, who believe that it supersedes previous holy books such as the Bible and the Qur’an. The teachings in the Kitab-i-Aqdas include laws, observances, and doctrinal and philosophical guidance provided by Baha’ullah for his followers around topics ranging from marriage and divorce through prohibitions and tithes.</p>
<p class='info'>Religious tradition: Baha’iism
