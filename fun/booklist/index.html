   /* Individual books in ranked lists have their scores calculated as
    *  1 − (rank in list ÷ number of books in list)
    * A book ranked as #1 in a list containing 100 books would 
    * receive a score of 1 − (1 ÷ 100) = 0.99.
    * A book ranked as #1 in a list of 5 books would receive
    * a score of 1 − (1 ÷ 5) = 0.8. Thus, the first books receives
    * a higher score, because it has been ranked as #1 when compared 
    * to more books. A book that appears in multiple lists will have
    * its scores from those lists aggregated into a single score.
    * For example, a book that appears as 1 of 100 in one list, 
    * 3 of 25 in another list, and 2 of 10 in a third list will 
    * receive an aggregated score of 
    *  1 − (1 ÷ 100) + 1 − (3 ÷ 25) + 1 − (2 ÷ 10)
    *  = 0.99 + 0.88 + 0.8 
    *  = 2.67
    * This score will be higher than the score for a book that
    * appears even as #1 in fewer lists. For example, a book that
    * appears as #1 of 100 in two different lists can have a maximum
    * score of 0.99 × 2 = 1.98. Thus, books that appear in more lists
    * are favored over books that appear in only a few lists, but
    * their ranking in those lists is also taken into account.
    * So even a book that appears as #5 in 10 different lists 
    * (e.g., of 100 books each) will receive a higher overall score 
    * than a book that appears as #1 on a single list (such as 
    * somebody's personal blog list):
    * (1 − (5 ÷ 100)) × 10 = 9.5 versus (1 − (1 ÷ 100)) = 0.99
    *
    * Because array indexes actually begin with 0 rather than 1,
    * the actual score for a book ranked as #1 in any list will be
    * 1, because it is calculated as 1 − (0 ÷ length) = 1 − 0
    * This actually gives somewhat more preference to books that 
    * appear as #1.

 * Also removes parenthetical information (often the author's name)
