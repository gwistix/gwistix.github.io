    <h1>A Grassy Hilltop</h1>

    <p>You awaken on a grassy hilltop, with no idea how you got there. The last thing you remember is a loud sound and a blinding light while you were still in the museum. The air smells charred like something very recently stopped burning. All you have with you is your backpack and the hand-held electronic tour companion from the museum, which is beeping softly like it does when there’s a nearby exhibit. You push the button.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>ELECTRONIC TOUR COMPANION<br>
[Static] Hello? [More static] Hello? Is there somebody there? If you can hear me, hold the button and tell me who you are and how you managed to keep an electronic tour companion after hours. Usually the guards take them as you’re leaving.</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
Ummm… I’m Timmy and I was in the museum but something happened.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>MAN ON ELECTRONIC TOUR COMPANION<br>
Timmy, huh? Where are you? And what are you still doing with the ETC? Are you still in the museum? My scanner here says you’re near the main entrance, but I just walked over there and I didn’t see you anywhere.</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
I don’t know where I am. I was in the museum and there was a loud sound and a bright light and now I’m not in the museum any more. I’m on top of a hill and I just want to go home.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>MAN ON ELECTRONIC TOUR COMPANION<br>
Listen, kid, it sounds like you’re talking about the lightning strike from a few minutes ago, but what you’re saying doesn’t make any sense. I was here when it happened, but it was just a little lightning. Now I’m sitting here in the museum security office and the screen in front of me is telling me your ETC is somewhere by the main entrance. What can you see from where you are? I’m Richard Owen, by the way—Dr. Owen. I’m a paleontologist here at the museum.</p>

<p>You look out across the landscape. It doesn’t look like you’re even anywhere near the city. All you can see is forests and rivers and more hills, and off in the distance, something that looks like a bright blue light.</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
Well, I’m on top of a hill and down in front of me there’s a big open area and then a river, and off to the left there’s what looks like a forest, and way off in the distance kind of between the forest and the river there’s some kind of blue light. I think that’s where I’m supposed to go.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Look, kid, I don’t know what’s going on or how you got ahold of one of the electronic guides, but if you’re really on a hilltop somewhere I don’t think you’re supposed to go anywhere. You should probably just stay put until someone comes to find you; it’ll be easier for people to see you if you’re up on a hilltop, and wandering around is just going to get you in more trouble.</p>

<h2>DECISION TIME</h2>
<p>Do you go toward the blue light in the distance, or stay where you are?</p>
