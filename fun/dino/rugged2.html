    <h1>The River and Rugged Terrain</h1>

    <p>You ride your brachiosaurus north toward the blue light, which is now pulsating rapidly. You soon come to a shallow river. As you near the river, you hear an ear-splitting roar from the other side, but your brachiosaurus is unfazed. You notice that the light on your ECT is flashing and you push the button.</p>

		<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Finally! I thought you were never going to come back on. Whatever you do, don’t go near the brachiosauruses.</p>

	  <p class='tt'>YOU<br>
I’m riding one right now.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
What?! That’s completely incomprehensible! And just where are you riding it to?</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
We’re going toward the blue light. It’s starting to get dark and I can tell that that’s where I’m supposed to go.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Timmy, this isn’t a game. The area by the blue light is the last place you want to go. If you really are in the quarry the museum’s based on, that’s the Yutyrannus exhibit.</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
The <em>what</em>-tyrannus exhibit?</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Yutyrannus. It’s a large tyrannosaur, smaller than a T-rex, but still very dangerous. It’s also the largest carnivore—er—meat-eater ever discovered that’s covered completely with feathers.</p>

	<p class='tt'>YOU<br>
A mini T-rex that’s covered in feathers? That doesn’t sound scary at all!</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
I’m warning you, Timmy, don’t go anywhere near it!</p>

	<h2>DECISION TIME</h2>
	<p>Do you cross the river into Yutyrannus territory, or listen to the doctor?</p>
