    <h1>Yutyrannus Territory</h1>

    <p>You and your brachiosaurus cross the river into the rugged terrain of the yutyrannus’ territory. As you cross the river, you notice that the other brachiosauruses have followed you and are crossing as well. Ahead you see the pulsing blue light, flashing faster and faster the closer you get. You hear another ear-shattering roar and in the waning light of the sun and the eerie pulsing light from up ahead, you see the terrible form of the yutyrannus. It’s more than three times as tall as you, and where you sit on the brachiosaurus’ back, you’re almost level with its enormous head and huge, gaping jaws. Long, thin feathers cover its entire body, beginning at the back of the head and stretching down all the way to the end of its tail. As the yutyrannus sees you, it stretches out the feathers around the back of its head, revealing a jagged crest. The puffed out feathers on its arms and body make it look even bigger than it is, and the fan-like burst of feathers at the end of its tail writhe back and forth as it slowly walks forward, watching you with each step.</p>

	<p>The yutyrannus roars once more and the other brachiosauruses crowd around you, shielding you from it. It is fearsome, but it is no match for an entire herd of brachiosauruses, and it knows it. As you approach the blue light, it begins flashing like a strobe light, faster and faster, and blindingly bright. The herd makes a circle around the light and you dismount, and then walk <em>into</em> the light…</p>
