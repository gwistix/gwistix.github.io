    <h1>SCENE: A Grassy Hilltop (still)</h1>
    
    EXT. We see Timmy sitting down, leaning back and looking across the landscape. The camera cuts to his view and we see a river and forests and a blue light pulsing in the distance. The camera cuts to a closer shot, and we a small red light flashing on the electronic tour companion.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy decides to follow the doctor’s advice and stay where he is. He looks out across the landscape and notices that the sun is getting low on the horizon. The blue light in the distance is pulsing slightly, very slowly. Timmy looks down at his electronic tour companion and sees that there’s a small light flashing on it. He pushes the button.

	Oh good, you’re back. Didn’t you hear the ETC beeping?</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
	I did before, but now it was just flashing and not beeping.</p>

Oh, well, the batteries probably need to be recharged. Anyway, I called the police and they’re going to set up a search party. I’m going to stay here where I can talk to you until we get this all figured out. You’re not going anywhere, right?</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
Right… Except… It looks like the sun is starting to set. Shouldn’t I try to find shelter or something? I mean, maybe there are other people around.</p>

Well, it couldn’t hurt to look around a bit, as long as you stay close to the hill. It sounds like wherever you are, you’re definitely out of the city, so it’ll be a while before anyone comes looking for you. If the battery really is getting low we should talk as little as possible, so just let me know what’s going on every few minutes.</p>

<br>We see Timmy getting up and dusting himself off.
