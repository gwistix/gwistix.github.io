    <h1>SCENE: The River and Rugged Terrain</h1>
    
    EXT. We see Timmy riding a brachiosaurus across a river. We hear a loud roaring sound. Camera cuts to unconcerned brachiosauruses face.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy rides his brachiosaurus north toward the blue light, which is now pulsating rapidly. He soon comes to a shallow river. As he nears the river, he hears an ear-splitting roar from the other side, but his brachiosaurus is unfazed. Timmy notices that the light on his ECT is flashing and he pushes the button.</p>

Finally! I thought you were never going to come back on. Whatever you do, don’t go near the brachiosauruses.</p>

	  <p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
I’m riding one right now.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
What?! That’s completely incomprehensible! And just where are you riding it to?</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
We’re going toward the blue light. It’s starting to get dark and I can tell that that’s where I’m supposed to go.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Timmy, this isn’t a game. The area by the blue light is the last place you want to go. If you really are in the quarry the museum’s based on, that’s the Yutyrannus exhibit.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
The <em>what</em>-tyrannus exhibit?</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Yutyrannus. It’s a large tyrannosaur, smaller than a T-rex, but still very dangerous. It’s also the largest carnivore—er—meat-eater ever discovered that’s covered completely with feathers.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
A mini T-rex that’s covered in feathers? That doesn’t sound scary at all!</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
I’m warning you, Timmy, don’t go anywhere near it!</p>

<br>We see Timmy shrugging and looking into the camera.

	<h2>TEXT: DECISION TIME</h2>
	<p>Should Timmy cross the river into Yutyrannus territory, or listen to the doctor?</p>
