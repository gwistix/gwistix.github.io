    <h1>SCENE: The Riverbank and Northern Forest</h1>
    
    EXT. We see a river and dense forest on the other side. As the camera moves into the forest, we see movements off to the side. We hear swishing sounds. The camera cuts to a still frame of a large bird-like dinosaur with claws and teeth.

    <p>TEXT: Standing at the edge of the river, Timmy sees dense forest on the other side. After crossing, he begins to hear swishing sounds in the forest around him. He catches glimpses of movement between the trees, and finally he gets a brief but clear view of what looks like a large bird with long claws and sharp teeth. Something about it looks strangely familiar to Timmy… He backs up against a big tree and pushes the button on his ECT.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
	Dr. Owen, are you there? There’s some kind of big sharp-toothed bird running around in the forest. It has big claws on its feet.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Timmy, what are you doing? I’ve been trying to contact you. You need to get out of there now.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
What do you mean?</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
If the ECT really is showing me where you are based on the museum exhibits, you’re right in the middle of the northern forest. Here in the museum, that’s exhibit is filled with velociraptors.</p>

<p>As Dr. Owen is speaking, another of the large sharp-toothed birds dashes through the trees to your left.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
What? All I see is these big bird things. They’re a little freaky, but nothing like a velociraptor.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
Timmy, those <em>are</em> velociraptors! In the movies they show them without feathers, but in real life they were covered in them!</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
But they’re only a few feet tall! They’re not like the velociraptors in the movies at all!
</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
They’re just as dangerous as the ones in the movies. You need to get out of there fast. If this indicator is right, it looks like you’re right in the middle of the forest, so just pick which way you want to go.</p>

<br>We hear flowing water and see a forest scene lit from far behind by a pulsing blue light.

<p>TEXT: Timmy can still hear the river off to the west. The blue light is off toward the northwest. He can try to cross back to the other side of the river and enter the forest to the west, or he can continue north through the velociraptor forest and try to come out the other side to the north.</p>

<br>We see Timmy shrugging and looking directly at the camera.

	<h2>TEXT: DECISION TIME</h2>
	<p>Should Timmy go back across the river, or continue north through raptor territory?</p>
