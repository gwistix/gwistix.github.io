    <h1>SCENE: The Northern Plain</h1>
    
    EXT. We see a large ostrich-like gallimimus, mostly covered in feathers. It is standing in a large grassy plain.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy decides to ignore the doctor’s warning and approach the gallimimus. It looks like it could probably run pretty fast. If he could ride it, he could get to the blue light in no time.</p>

	<p>The lone gallimimus looks up as Timmy approaches, but seems unconcerned. As he draw nearer, it turns its head and lets out a loud squawking sound, then grows completely still. Timmy is now only a few feet away from the dinosaur. He reaches out a hand slowly to show that he means no harm. The gallimimus leaps into action, flapping its large wing-like arms and stamping its feet. Timmy is knocked to the ground by one of the flapping arms, and rolls out of the way just in time to narrowly avoid being stamped by one of the creature’s enormous clawed feet. As Timmy scrambles back to a safe distance, the gallimimus spreads its arms wide and opens its mouth in an unmistakable hiss. As Timmy rubs a bruised arm, he decides that he probably should have listened to Dr. Owen.</p>
	
	<br>We see more rugged, treeless terrain, and in the distance behind, a flashing blue light.

	<p>TEXT: Timmy makes his way west toward the more rugged terrain there. He can see the blue light flashing off in that direction as well.</p>
