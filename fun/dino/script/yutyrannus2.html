    <h1>SCENE: Yutyrannus Territory</h1>
    
    EXT. We see Timmy riding on a brachiosaurus with other brachiosauruses trailing behind. In the same frame, we see a large feathered yutyrannus with its mouth open, threatening Timmy. We hear a loud roar.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy and his brachiosaurus cross the river into the rugged terrain of the yutyrannus’ territory. As he crosses the river, he notices that the other brachiosauruses have followed and are crossing as well. Ahead Timmy sees the pulsing blue light, flashing faster and faster the closer he gets. He hears another ear-shattering roar and in the waning light of the sun and the eerie pulsing light from up ahead, he sees the terrible form of the yutyrannus. It’s more than three times as tall as he is, and where he sit on the brachiosaurus’ back, he’s almost level with its enormous head and huge, gaping jaws. Long, thin feathers cover its entire body, beginning at the back of the head and stretching down all the way to the end of its tail. As the yutyrannus sees Timmy, it stretches out the feathers around the back of its head, revealing a jagged crest. The puffed out feathers on its arms and body make it look even bigger than it is, and the fan-like burst of feathers at the end of its tail writhe back and forth as it slowly walks forward, watching Timmy with each step.</p>

<br>We see the brachiosaurus herd circled around Timmy, who is in the center of the circle next to the mysterious blue light.

	<p>TEXT: The yutyrannus roars once more and the other brachiosauruses crowd around Timmy, shielding him from it. It is fearsome, but it is no match for an entire herd of brachiosauruses, and it knows it. As Timmy approaches the blue light, it begins flashing like a strobe light, faster and faster, and blindingly bright. The herd makes a circle around the light and you dismount, and then walk <em>into</em> the light…</p>
