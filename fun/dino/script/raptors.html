    <h1>SCENE: The Raptor Forest</h1>
    
    EXT. We see Timmy running through a forest. We hear swishing sounds. The camera cuts to a top view and we see Timmy running but surrounded by velociraptors.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy decides to continue north through the velociraptor territory, hoping he’ll come out the other side rather than backtracking across the river. After a few minutes, he hears more sounds in the surrounding forest. He catches more glimpses of the strange, feathered velociraptors. They look like they only come up to the top of Timmy’s legs, but the glimpses he gets of their claws convince him that Dr. Owen was right. As he continues through the forest, he realizes that a group of them is following him, with a few of them moving up and around to the front! Timmy needs to think fast! It’s too late to go back now…</p>
    
    <br>We see Timmy shrugging while looking at the camera, a frightened expression on his face.

	<h2>TEXT: DECISION TIME</h2>
	<p>Should Timmy make a run for it, or climb a tree and try to wait them out?</p>
