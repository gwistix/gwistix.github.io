    <h1>SCENE: The Western Forest</h1>
    
    EXT. We see a dense forest with many different types of trees. Camera cuts to some tree trunks that are thick and grayish, unlike the others. Camera pans up to reveal a brachiosaurus.

    <p>TEXT: Timmy crosses the river into the western forest. The trees here look like pine trees and a few other kinds, but Timmy don’t really know much about trees. He pulls a leftover apple from your backpack and eats it as he walks. After a few minutes the trees thin out a bit and the going gets easier. In the forest, the shadows cast by the setting sun make it hard for Timmy to see what’s ahead. He comes out into a bright clearing, and as his eyes start to adjust, you can’t believe what you’re seeing. There’s a set of four enormous tree-sized legs a few yards in front of Timmy. As he follows the legs up, he sees an even more enormous body, and a neck that keeps going up to an impossibly high height. At the top of the neck is a head, and it’s looking right at Timmy—it’s a long-necked dinosaur! Timmy takes a few hurried steps back into the cover of the trees and pounds down on the button on his ETC.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
	Dr. Owen, you better be listening! I’m standing in front of an enormous dinosaur! It’s a long-neck dinosaur… It’s a—ummm—a brontosaurus!</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
I was wondering if you’d ever push that button again; I’ve been trying to contact you! The batteries in your ECT must be running out, or you would have hear it beeping. My display here says you’re in the brachiosaurus exhibit. Keep your distance. Those things are <em>big</em>.</p>

  EXT. We see Timmy looking up at the brachiosaurus slyly.

  <p>TEXT: Timmy looks up at the brachiosaurus and has an idea… 

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
I’m going to try to ride it.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
What?! No you’re not! Haven’t you learned anything? Stay as far away as you can!</p>

<br>We see another brachiosaurus in the background. We hear a loud bellowing sound.

  <p>TEXT: As Dr. Owen is speaking, another brachiosaurus further back in the clearing looks at the dinosaur closest to Timmy and starts bellowing.</p>

	<p class='tt'>TIMMY<br>
If I can ride it, nothing will be able to bother me! It’s so big, I’m sure no other dinosaurs would even come near. The sun is really setting now, and I really feel like the blue light has something to do with me getting back home! I need to get there as soon as I can.</p>

	<p class='tt etc'>DR. OWEN<br>
	Look, maybe riding it would be a good idea, but the chances of it letting you are slim. Brachiosaurus is a herbivore and a gentle one from what we can tell, but it could still knock you over or step on you without even noticing. Don’t even think about going near that thing!</p>
	
	<br>We see Timmy shrugging while looking toward the camera.

	<h2>DECISION TIME</h2>
	<p>Should Timmy approach the brachiosaurus, or keep his distance?</p>
