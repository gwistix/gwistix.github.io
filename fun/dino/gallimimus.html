    <h1>The Northern Plain</h1>

    <p>You decide to ignore the doctor’s warning and approach the gallimimus. It looks like it could probably run pretty fast. If you could ride it, you could get to the blue light in no time.</p>

	<p>The lone gallimimus looks up as you approach, but seems unconcerned. As you draw nearer, it turns its head and lets out a loud squawking sound, then grows completely still. You are now only a few feet away from the dinosaur. You reach out a hand slowly to show that you mean no harm. The gallimimus leaps into action, flapping its large wing-like arms and stamping its feet. You are knocked to the ground by one of the flapping arms, and roll out of the way just in time to narrowly avoid being stamped by one of the creature’s enormous clawed feet. As you scramble back to a safe distance, the gallimimus spreads its arms wide and opens its mouth in an unmistakable hiss. As you rub a bruised arm, you decide you probably should have listened to Dr. Owen.</p>

	<p>You make your way west toward the more rugged terrain there. You can see the blue light flashing off in that direction as well.</p>
