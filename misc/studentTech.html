  <th>SprintReader</th>
  <td valign='top'><p>SprintReader‚Äôs target audience is anyone who struggles with reading or wants to read faster.</p>
<p>SprintReader is a free Google Chrome extension that allows users to read a text passage or document one word at a time or one phrase at a time.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>SprintReader reduces eye strain that results from online reading by parsing a text into small segments or words.</p> 
<p>SprintReader allows users to adjust text size, color, font, and reading rate (words per minute). It centers a word or short phrase within the reading window and then ‚Äúplays‚Äù the text.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Many students struggle with visual disabilities, such as dyslexia and strabismus (wandering eye). These conditions can make letters change position or even float on a page. Students with these disabilities have trouble decoding, spelling, and tracking. SprintReader can be used as an assistive technology for these students because it prevents the eye/brain from becoming distracted by too many words and letters. Teachers can load any text into SprintReader, and the student can decode the text at a rate that is visually comfortable and effective.</p>
<p>Students who read slowly or who would like to read faster can use SprintReader to train their eyes/brains.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>When my 10th-grade ELA students need to read online, I can recommend SprintReader as a resource to help them read quickly and fluently.</p> 
<p>I can also use SprintReader as an assistive technology for my students who struggle with reading.</p> 
<p>SprintReader would be especially useful in elementary grades, in which students are just learning to read.</p> 
<p>My son has a visual processing disability and I am going to try this on him! üòä</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>Twine Story Engine</th>
  <td valign='top'><p>Twine‚Äôs target audience is web-based writers making interactive fiction.</p>
<p>Twine allows users to brainstorm and storyboard a topic/idea/text.</p>
<p>Twine allows users to write a story in a page-by-page view that maps plot and subplots.</p> 
<p>Twine allows users to create nonlinear text-based choose-your-own adventure games/ stories.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Twine allows users to create individual story pages that interact on a grid.</p>
<p>Twine is available within a web browser, as a desktop download, and as a smartphone app.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Students can use Twine to write original works of fiction, including choose-your-own adventure stories.</p>
<p>Students can use Twine to brainstorm and storyboard a topic, idea, or text that they need to explore.</p>
<p>Students can use Twine to map story plots and subplots.</p>
<p>Students can use Twine as a repository for research information, like an ePortfolio.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Since I teach 10th-grade ELA, Twine could be a useful technology to help my students develop original stories.</p>
<p>My students could also use Twine to storyboard a text and visualize the interaction of its plot and subplots.</p>
<p>My students could use Twine to prepare their ideas for a multimedia presentation or research paper.</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>GameSalad</th>
  <td valign='top'><p>GameSalad‚Äôs target audience is amateur game designers.</p>
<p>GameSalad allows users to create games and apps that can be played online or on smart devices (ex: phones and tablets).</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>GameSalad is a web-based game creation software for Mac and Windows users. </p>
<p>GameSalad allows users to create games without using code. Users can select pre-existing images/icons to use as characters and setting elements; users simply drag and drop these images/icons onto a work screen. Users select cause-and-effect behaviors for the characters and setting elements.</p>
<p>GameSalad allows users to publish and sell their games across multiple platforms.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Students can use GameSalad to create original games and apps.</p>
<p>Students can use GameSalad to create interactive stories.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>My 10th-grade ELA students could use GameSalad to create a game that retells a text we are studying. For example, if we were reading <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>, the students could create games in which the characters hunt for pigs, pick fruit, and build fires.</p>
<p>My students could also use GameSalad to transform <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite> into an interactive story that prompts the audience to perform certain tasks.</p>
<p>Some schools may already use GameSalad in computer science classes, but it can also complement learning in subject areas like ELA, science, and social studies.</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>Igloo</th>
  <td valign='top'><p>Igloo‚Äôs target audience is private industry and public buildings, such as museums and observatories.</p>
<p>Igloo allows users to participate in an immersive 3D visual experience. It makes every wall of a room into a projection screen.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Igloo is a hardware-based technology that uses high-resolution projectors and wall screens to transport participants to any setting‚Äîpast, present, future, and even fictional.</p> 
<p>Igloo specializes in visualization ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù (ex: field trips) but also has the capability to superimpose visual layers/projections.</p>
<p>Igloo allows users to participate in larger-than-life simulations that pertain to many professional fields, such as engineering.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Igloo could transform brick-and-mortar classrooms into immersive experiences. As students learned about dinosaurs, the classroom walls could fill with Jurassic scenery and animals, including to-scale images of dinosaurs!</p>
<p>As students learned about the French Revolution, the classroom walls could take them to the courtroom and guillotine in Paris!</p>
<p>Igloo could even create fictional environments to contextualize literature.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>In the future, Igloo could create a line of education projections. Instead of asking my students to look up facts on daily life in Shakespeare‚Äôs time period, they could actually ‚Äútravel‚Äù back in time to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of the day.</p> 
<p>When reading a story, I could set the mood by projecting scenery that complements the story‚Äîlike a beachy jungle for <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>.</p> 
<p>Similarly, students could strengthen their presentations and oral reports by using a projected environment.</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>Microsoft Hololens</th>
  <td valign='top'><p>MS Hololens‚Äôs target audience is people who enjoy immersive digital experiences, such as die-hard gamers.</p> 
<p>MS Hololens is an augmented reality (AR) headset that essentially has all the functionality of a PC or laptop.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>MS Hololens allows users to participate in the same activities that they would use a computer for‚Äîsuch as video conferencing, designing software, gaming, web browsing, etc.</p>
<p>The MS Hololens is more powerful and immersive than Google Glass, whose capabilities are only on par with a smartphone.</p> 
<p>Some people prefer the MS Hololens to a true VR device, like Facebook‚Äôs Oculus, because users can still safely interact with their real environments (ex: walk around).</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Rather than needing a computer/laptop, students could perform their work through the MS Hololens, which uses motion sensors for the hands.</p> 
<p>Students could ‚Äútravel‚Äù into science lessons (ex: the digestive track), watch historic events (ex: the French Revolution), and contextualize literature through immersive environments.</p></td>
  <td valign='top'><p>Like Igloo, but on a smaller and more individualized/ differentiated scale, students could use MS Hololens to experience Shakespeare‚Äôs time period or feel immersed in a story‚Äôs setting.</p> 
<p>In the future, as this technology develops further, I‚Äôd have my students design immersive environments and activities for Hololens.</p></td>
